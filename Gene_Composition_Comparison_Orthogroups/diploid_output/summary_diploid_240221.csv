Total,total number of genes actually compared between the two algorithms,,,,,,,,,,
PropOne,proportion of genes/orthogroup with one Arabidopsis gene copy between the two orthogroups,,,,,,,,,,
oriATgenes_same,"number of genes where there are multiple copies of Arabidopsis genes in an algorithm's orthogroup output, and the Arabidopsis gene composition between the two algorithms are exactly the same",,,,,,,,,,
combAvg_same,number of actual orthogroups to compare after removing the duplicate orthogroup comparisons for scenarios with more than one Arabidopsis gene copy between the two algorithms and the Arabidopsis gene composition between the two algorithms are exactly the same,,,,,,,,,,
oriATgenes_diff,number of genes where the number of Arabidopsis genes in an orthogroup  are different between the two algorithms,,,,,,,,,,
